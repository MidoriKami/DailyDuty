DailyDuty is a XivLauncher/Dalamud plugin.

DailyDuty allows you to easily and automatically track various daily and weekly tasks.
DailyDuty is designed for people that need _**constant reminders**_ to do things or else they will entirely forget to do them.

The goal of this plugin is to allow you to more easily and more passively complete tasks that reward weekly or daily bonuses.

DailyDuty will **not** track anything to do with Retainers or Free Companies, for that use `Accountant` by `Ottermandias`

## Configuration Window

## Notifications

DailyDuty uses chat messages to notify you of tasks that are able to be completed.

You will not see notifications for tasks that aren't yet available to be completed, such as Fashion Report, until there is something that you the user are able to do.

You will not see notifications for tasks that are "Complete", you can use `/dd status` to view the status of the various modules.

DailyDuty also includes clickable chat links that have an associated action they will do once clicked on.
Modules that have clickable links will describe what that modules links will do, and allow you to enable or disable the link.

**All chat messages can only been seen by you, Dalamud Plugins are client side only**
 
 (Example notifications, this is not a complete list)
